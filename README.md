# Impressions of Task 1

1. The course on Udacity gave a firm understanding of basic Git functionality. It is perfect for beginners, since it makes sure
   everything is clear for you via practice tasks, quizes and reflections.
2. [learngitbranching.js.org](http://learngitbranching.js.org) (followed from [try.github.io](http://try.github.io)) puts acquired knowledge to the test, and teaches some extra commands and techniques as well. Visualisations are great, but the only flaw is that I couldn't access from the menu levels starting from "remote" section.

Now I can hopefully say that I've learnt how to use Git.
