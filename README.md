## Impressions of Task 1

1. The course on Udacity gave a firm understanding of basic Git functionality. It is perfect for
   beginners, since it makes sure everything is clear for you via practice tasks, quizes and reflections.
2. [learngitbranching.js.org](http://learngitbranching.js.org) (followed from [try.github.io](http://try.github.io))
   puts acquired knowledge to the test, and teaches some extra commands and techniques as well.
   Visualisations are great, but the only flaw is that I couldn't access from the menu levels
   starting from "remote" section.

Now I can hopefully say that I've learnt how to use Git.


## Linux CLI, and HTTP
[finished](task_linux_cli/finished.png)
1. *what was new to you*
   1. I had known some command before, but the course helped me learn some other useful ones
      and get it all ingrained im my mind.
   2. Every time it came to networks, I used to get lost. Now I've got a more clear understanding
      of how the HTTP protocol works and how clients and servers communicate.
   3. How authentication and caching are performed.
2. *what surprised you*
   1. Command line has its own text editor!
   2. I had never invegtigated status code meanings, so I was quite impressed when saw them all.
   3. There is so much detail about caching.
3. *what you intend to use in future*
   1. Hohestly, I don't think I'll use the command line in everyday life, but when working in git,
      for example, why not. Besides, bash scripting and modifying environment seem redundant.
   2. In a project that needs to exchange data between hosts.
   3. In a big project that requires traffic optimisations or tracking individual users.


## Git Collaboration

[lesson 2](task_git_collaboration/ud456.png)
1. *what was new to you*
   1. Although I've finished a Git/Github course for Task 1, I learnt something from this course.
      Such as numerous flags for git log, or the .gitignore file.
   2. I got lots of advices about collaborating via Github.
2. *what surprised you*
   1. git log is powerful!
   2. Communicating with other developers turns out to be kinda complicated...
3. *what you intend to use in future*
   1. Everything. It is basic Git functionality.
   2. I will push my own works to remotes on Github, and, when the time comes, will send/manage
      pull requests on larger projects, as well as interact with other developers.


## Intro to HTML and CSS

[HTML](task_html_css_intro/html.png) |
[CSS](task_html_css_intro/css.png)
1. *what was new to you*
   1. Although I have experience with HTML, I've never used such tags as `<del>`, `<ins>`, `<mark>` or
      definition list.
   2. In CSS, the formula for calculating specificity.
2. *what surprised you*
   1. `<i>` and `<b>` have semantic definition!
   2. In the very first CSS task on HTMLAcademy, they used `border-bottom` to draw a triangle!
3. *what you intend to use in future*
   1. It is all very basic, so I'll sure use everything.
   2. Same. And especially helpful is knowing how cascading works.


## Responsive Web Design

[Flexbox Froggy](task_responsive_web_design/flexboxfroggy.png)
1. *what was new to you*
   1. I've never approached responsive design properly, and now I finally know some common principles,
      such as major/minor breakpoints for different screen sizes, making certain types of elements
      responsive, conventional page layouts etc.
   2. I've played Flexbox Froggy before (recompleted it anyways), so nothing new :)
2. *what surprised you*
   1. Designing responsively doesn't look that hard once I know how to approach it.
   2. I was surprised how many tasks can be solved with ease using flexes.
3. *what you intend to use in future*
   1. From now on I'll develop every serious website with responsiveness in mind.
   2. Flexes are incredibly powerful, I love them!

## JS Basics

[freeCodeCamp](task_js_basics/freeCodeCamp.png)
1. *what was new to you*
   1. I knew JS before this task, so nothing new. However, it was useful to revise hoisting,
      global/function/block scopes, function expressions/declarations etc.
   2. Those tasks didn't take me too long to solve, but two of them simply couldn't run in the
      tester (whereas in console it all worked fine). Anyway, I had fun pushing my skills to the limit!
2. *what surprised you*
   1. With `&&` and `||` one of the operands sometimes isn't even checked! That's an interesting
      mechanic I never paid attention to.
   2. With `RegExp` it is so much easier to work with strings!
3. *what you intend to use in future*
   1. The only unclear thing is named function expressions. I mean, they do nothing, why use them?
      Other than that, JS basics are a must-know.
   2. I'll probably come back to these algorythmic tasks, they are kinda fun and feel good to solve.

[freeCodeCamp](task_js_dom/freeCodeCamp.png)
1. *what was new to you*
   1. Interfaces, event loop, event phases, event delegation, reflow & repaint, DocumentFragment.
2. *what surprised you*
   1. I used to believe I know DOM... And made so many discoveries in one day! Furthermore, there
      are hundreds of interfaces, events properties and methods, all with their unique subtleties -
      excited to work with that!
3. *what you intend to use in future*
   1. Now I know how to minimise reflows, optimise event handlers, prevent page freezing with
      setTimeout() - I am in deep awe!

1. *what was new to you*
   1. `Proxy` object is used to define custom behavior for basic operations like assignment.
2. *what surprised you*
   1. I spent more time uploading my project to Github than actually working on it... Aside from
      `Proxy`, nothing really shocking.
3. *what you intend to use in future*
   1. Objects are a fundamental way of modelling complex systems, I'll work with them for sure.

[Codewars](http://codewars.com/users/vv2529)
1. *what was new to you*
   1. Functional, classical and pseudoclassical approaches to OOP in Javascript.
   2. Codewars offers a wide range of tasks of varying difficulty. Solving them is kinda fun, albeit
      it took me some time to get used to the website's interface...
   3. Frogger game was an interesting project to work on! I haven't done anything like this for a
      somewhat long time.
2. *what surprised you*
   1. Even though prior to ES6 there was no in-built `class` syntax, people came up with such an
      ingenious implementation using functions!
   2. After submitting a solution, Codewars shows how other people solved it. Some of those
      answers shocked me!
   3. Although I was proud of the code I had written, after a review there turned out to be plentiful
      flaws - not so much with the game logic, but with the code quality. This is a strong incentive
      to start developing good coding habits right now.
3. *what you intend to use in future*
   1. I believe ES6 classes are better to use nowadays than functions.
   2. Creative approach to solving problems is a useful skill indeed.
   3. As the mentor suggested, we should write code that is maintainable, scalable, customizable and
      human-readable.

1. *what was new to you*
   1. I decided to revise ES6 class syntax for this excercise. Also, from provided articles, I
      learned about DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles, as well as S.O.L.I.D., which are good to bear in mind.
2. *what surprised you*
   1. `.toString()` method is automatically used to convert an object to a string! Also, although
      implementing classes might take a lot of lines of code, using them is very simple and fits
      logical models in my mind.
3. *what you intend to use in future*
   1. Classes are a perfect method to model various systems of all shapes and sizes, knowing a
      proper way to work with them is a big advantage.

1. *what was new to you*
   1. Flip animation using 3d transformations, one-line function for array shuffle,
   `node.append(node1, node2, ...)` for adding multiple elements without `DocumentFragment`,
   Prettier tool for maintaining code style.
2. *what surprised you*
   1. Long names for variables/functions can be better than short ones, since they are more descriptive.
      I used to violate this notion all the time...
3. *what you intend to use in future*
   1. The larger a js file gets, the harder it is to read, so it might be a good idea to divide the
      code into modules. Ultimately, there are lots of practices to keep your code maintainable,
      which I still have to master.

1. *what was new to you*
   1. While building this application, I tried out a few useful things, such as adding box-shadow
      and doubling it on hover for a sence of depth, or detecting less important content and hiding
      it to save space on smaller viewports etc.
2. *what surprised you*
   1. When I get stuck, a good strategy is to back up and start from scratch: rewritten code will
      probably be more efficient and concise.
3. *what you intend to use in future*
   1. I should get comfortable with promises, async/await, ES6 modules, choose my own style for
      developing web apps, and perhaps focus on using Git frequently, instead of committing once
      when the whole thing is already done.
